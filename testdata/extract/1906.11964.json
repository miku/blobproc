It introduces\nthe OpenCitations Data Model and the SPAR (Semantic Publishing and Referencing)\nOntologies for encoding scholarly bibliographic and citation data in RDF, and OpenCitations’\nopen software of generic applicability for searching, browsing and providing REST APIs over\nRDF triplestores. It describes Open Citation Identifiers (OCIs), globally unique and persistent\nidentifiers for bibliographic citations, and the OpenCitations OCI Resolution Service that returns\nbibliographic and citation metadata when queried with an OCI. And it describes the\nOpenCitations Corpus (OCC), a database of open downloadable bibliographic and citation data\nharvested from bibliographic references in the scholarly literature and made available in RDF\nunder a Creative Commons public domain dedication. Finally, it outlines the Open Citation\nIndexes of citation data openly available in third-party bibliographic databases that\n\n\fOpenCitations is currently making available as Linked Open Datasets accessible via its REST\nAPI, of which the first and largest is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of Crossref DOI-to-DOI\nCitations which currently contains over 445 million bibliographic citations.\n\nIntroduction\nBibliographic citations – the conceptual directional links from a citing bibliographic entity to a\ncited bibliographic entity created when the author of a published work acknowledges other\nworks in its bibliographic references – are one of the most fundamental types of bibliographic\nmetadata, and are central to the world of scholarship. They knit together independent works of\nscholarship into a global endeavour, and are important for assigning credit to other researchers.\nThe open availability of citation data is a crucial requirement for the bibliometrics and\nscientometrics domain, since it “is essential to promote reproducibility and appraisal of research,\nreduce misconduct, and ensure equitable access to and participation in science” ​(Sugimoto et\nal., 2017)​.\nAt present, the two most authoritative sources of citation data are Clarivate Analytics’ Web of\nScience (WoS), which grew from the Science Citation Index created by Eugene Garfield in\n1964, and Elsevier’s Scopus, launched in 2004. Neither are open, most research universities\nhaving to pay tens of thousands of dollars annually to access one or both of them, while\ninstitutions and independent scholars that cannot afford such costs have no access. More\nrecently, in addition to a number of subject-specific indexes, other sources of general citation\ndata have been made available by other commercial companies, for example by Google\n(Google Scholar), Digital Science (Dimensions) and Microsoft (Microsoft Academic, formerly\nMicrosoft Academic Search). However, while access to these is free, all have significant license\nrestrictions on users’ ability to reuse and republish the citation data they provide, which\nseriously limits the full description and reproducibility of research studies using these data.\nOpenCitations (​http://opencitations.net​) has been established for the specific purpose of\ndisrupting that status quo, by providing a fully free and open alternative for accessing global\nscholarly citation data. In this article we introduce the main data and services that OpenCitations\nprovides, we describes the known uses of its data within the scientometrics community, and we\ndescribe the planned future developments in terms of new data and initiatives.\n\nOpenCitations: its advocacy and principles\nOpenCitations is a relatively new independent scholarly infrastructure organization dedicated to\nopen scholarship and the publication of open bibliographic and citation data by the use of\nSemantic Web (Linked Data) technologies. It is also engaged in advocacy for open citations,\nparticularly in its role as a key founding member of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC,\nhttps://i4oc.org​). That Initiative was formed to promote the release of open citation data, and\nexplicitly asked the leading scholarly publishers, who were already depositing the reference lists\n\n\fof their publications at Crossref (​https://www.crossref.org/​), to release them into the public\ndomain by setting their Crossref references distribution option to “Open” (for details, see\nhttps://www.crossref.org/reference-distribution/​). As a result, the proportion of publications with\nreferences deposited at Crossref that are open has shot from 1% at the launch of I4OC in April\n2017 to 55% today, so that Crossref is now publishing more than 500 million bibliographic\nreferences openly on the Web, that have been reused by OpenCitations for providing open\ncitation data and by related services that can be used freely by the general public.\nOpenCitations espouses fully the founding principles of Open Science. It complies with the FAIR\ndata principles ​(Wilkinson et al., 2016) proposed by Force11 (​https://www.force11.org​) that open\nscholarly data should be ​findable​, ​accessible​, ​interoperable and ​re-usable​, and it complies\nwith the recommendations of the Initiative for Open Citations (I4OC, ​https://i4oc.org​, of which\nOpenCitations is a founding member) that citation data in particular should be ​structured​,\nseparable​, and ​open​. On this specific topic, OpenCitations has recently published a formal\ndefinition of an Open Citation ​(Peroni \u0026 Shotton, 2018a)​, and has launched a system for\nglobally unique and persistent identifiers (PIDs) for bibliographic citations – Open Citation\nIdentifiers (OCIs) – described in the next section.\n\nOpen Citation Identifiers\nThe Open Citation Identifier (OCI) is a globally unique persistent identifier (PID) for open\nbibliographic citations, as defined in ​(Peroni \u0026 Shotton, 2018a)​. The Open Citation Identifier\nsystem has been developed by OpenCitations, which maintains a resolution service for OCIs at\nhttp://opencitations.net/oci​. Given a valid OCI as input, this resolution service is able to retrieve\nmetadata about the identified citation in RDF (either as RDF/XML, Turtle or JSON-LD), or in\nScholix, JSON or CSV formats.\nEach OCI has a simple structure: the lower-case letters “oci” followed by a colon, followed by\ntwo sequences of numerals separated by a dash. The first sequence identifies the citing\npublication and the supplier database within which its metadata are to be found (e.g. Crossref or\nthe OCC), while the second sequence identifies the cited publication and the supplier database\nwithin which its metadata are to be found. Each supplier database is defined by a numerical\nprefix assigned by OpenCitations comprising a short sequence of positive integers delimited by\nzeros: for example 020 is the Crossref prefix, while 030 is the OCC prefix.\nThus oci:0302544384-0307295288 is a valid OCI for a citation between two publications\nrecorded in the OCC with internal OCC identifiers 2544384 and 7295288 respectively, while\noci:02001010806360107050663080702026306630509-02001010806360107050663080702026\n305630301 is a valid OCI for a citation between two publications recorded in Crossref with DOIs\ndoi:10.1186/1756-8722-6-59 and doi:10.1186/1756-8722-5-31 respectively. Details of how\nalphanumeric identifiers such as DOIs are transformed into the purely numerical sequences\nused in the OCIs is defined in ​(Peroni \u0026 Shotton, 2019)​. Since OCIs are designed for machine\n\n\fprocessing rather than human readability, the length of the numerical strings created by such\nalphanumeric transformations is not a problem.\nThe main advantages of treating citations as first-class data entities in their own right, with their\nown globally unique and persistent citation identifiers, are that:\n1. all the information regarding each citation can be stored in one place, with associated\nmetadata;\n2. citations become easier to describe, distinguish, count and process; and\n3. if available in aggregate, citations described in this manner are easier to analyze\nusing bibliometric methods, for example to visualize citation networks or to determine\nhow citation time spans vary by discipline.\nIt should be noted that OCIs are not opaque identifiers, since they explicitly encode directional\nrelationships between identified citing and cited entities, the provenance of the citation, i.e. the\ndatabase that contains it, and the type of identifiers used in that database to identify the citing\nand cited entities. The OCIs defining citations between a group of publications that cite one\nanother thus contain all the information required to construct the citation network of these\npublications.\nOpen Citation Identifiers (OCIs) have been accepted by the community, being recognized as\npersistent identifiers for citations by the EU FREYA Project (​https://www.project-freya.eu​)\n(Ferguson et al., 2018) and being registered by Identifiers.org (​https://identifiers.org/oci​), which\nis a PID registry and meta-resolver.\n\nThe OpenCitations Data Model and the SPAR\nOntologies\nTo enable the description of bibliographic and citation information in machine-readable terms,\nOpenCitations provided, maintains and updates the OpenCitations Data Model (OCDM) ​(Peroni\n\u0026 Shotton, 2018b)​, briefly summarised in ​Figure 1​.\n\n\fFigure 1.​ A diagram summarising the OpenCitations Data Model, implemented as the\nOpenCitations Ontology (OCO), available at ​https://w3id.org/oc/ontology​.\nThis OpenCitations Data Model is based on our widely used SPAR (Semantic Publishing and\nReferencing) Ontologies (​http://www.sparontologies.net​), which may be used to encode all\naspects of scholarly bibliographic and citation data in RDF, enabling them to be published as\nLinked Open Data (LOD). The SPAR Ontologies are more fully described in ​(Peroni \u0026 Shotton,\n2018c)​.\n\nThe OpenCitations datasets\nIn terms of data, OpenCitations first developed the OpenCitations Corpus (OCC,\nhttp://opencitations.net/corpus​) ​(Peroni, Shotton \u0026 Vitali, 2017)​, a database of open\ndownloadable bibliographic and citation data recorded in RDF and released under a Creative\nCommons CC0 public domain waiver, which currently contains information about ~14 million\ncitation links to over 7.5 million cited resources. The current content of the OCC has been\nmainly derived from biomedical articles within the Open Access Subset of PubMed Central\n(​https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/tools/openftlist/​), harvested using the Europe PubMed\nCentral REST API (​https://europepmc.org/RestfulWebService​), and contains information about\n\n\fthe citing and cited bibliographic resources (conference papers, book chapters, journal articles,\netc.) and their containers (academic proceedings, books, journals, etc.), the formats in which\nthey have been embodied (digital vs. print, first and ending pages, etc.), the names and roles of\nrelevant bibliographic agents (author, editor, publisher, etc.) related to the bibliographic\nresources, and all available identifiers (e.g. DOI, PubMed ID, PubMed Central ID, ISSN, ORCiD)\nfor the bibliographic resources and the agents involved.\nIn addition and separately, OpenCitations is currently developing a number of Open Citation\nIndexes (​http://opencitations.net/index​), using the data openly available in third-party\nbibliographic databases. The first and largest of these is COCI, the OpenCitations Index of\nCrossref open DOI-to-DOI citations (​http://opencitations.net/index/coci​) ​(Heibi, Peroni \u0026 Shotton,\n2019a)​, which presently contains information on more than 445 million citations, released under\na CC0 waiver.\nThe most recent index is CROCI, the Crowdsourced Open Citation Index\n(​http://opencitations.net/index/croci​) ​(Heibi, Peroni \u0026 Shotton, 2019b)​, which is designed to host\ncitation data submitted by third parties – authors, editors, scholars – allowing them to upload to\nOpenCitations citation data that are not elsewhere openly available, for example from their own\npublications, journals and reference collections, in an effort to fill the gap of missing citations\nfrom some publishers (particularly Elsevier) which are not presently available at Crossref as\nopen material.\nThe Indexes contain information about the citations themselves, in which the citations, instead\nof being considered as simple links, are treated as first-class data entities in their own right. This\npermits us to endow each citation with descriptive properties, such as the date on which the\ncitation was created, its timespan (i.e.the interval between the publication date of the cited entity\nand the publication date of the citing entity), and its type (e.g. whether or not it is a self-citation).\nAn in-depth description of the definition and use of citations as first-class data entities can be\nfound in ​(Shotton, 2018)​. In contrast to the OCC, these Indexes do not store metadata about the\nciting and cited bibliographic entities internally. Rather, these entities are identified in the\nIndexes by their unique identifiers (e.g. DOIs), enabling bibliographic information to be retrieved\non-the-fly upon request by means of the related API (see the operation “metadata” at\nhttps://w3id.org/oc/index/api/v1​ for additional information).\n\nOpenCitations software\nAll the aforementioned data are made available in RDF ​(Cyganiak, Wood, \u0026 Krötzsch, 2014)​,\nthis being the main format for expressing structured machine-readable data for the Web, and\nare stored in specialized graph databases for RDF known as triplestores. To provide access to\nthese data, OpenCitations provides open source software of generic applicability for searching,\nbrowsing and providing REST APIs over RDF triplestores (​https://github.com/opencitations​).\nThus, programmatic access to the OCC and COCI triplestores may be obtained using queries in\n\n\fSPARQL, the RDF query language ​(Harris \u0026 Seaborne, 2013)​, via their SPARQL endpoints, in\nJSON and CSV formats ​by using the OpenCitations REST API created using RAMOSE\n(​https://github.com/opencitations/ramose​), OpenCitations’ application for creating REST APIs\nover SPARQL endpoints ​(Heibi, Peroni \u0026 Shotton, 2019c)​, or via HTTP requests in ​different\nformats (HTML, RDF/XML, Turtle or JSON-LD, via content negotiation)​. The OpenCitations can\nalso be explored by humans using OSCAR, the OpenCitations RDF Search Application\n(​https://github.com/opencitations/oscar​), employing author name, work title (or part thereof) or\nidentifier (DOI, ORCID) as input, and the returned results can then be browsed using OSCAR's\nassociated browse interface, LUCINDA, the OpenCitations RDF Resource Browser\n(​https://github.com/opencitations/lucinda​). Metadata for individual bibliographic entities within\nOCC and citations within COCI can also be accessed via a simple Web form using their\nindividual URIs (e.g. ​https://w3id.org/oc/corpus/br/1​), and downloads of the entire OCC and\nCOCI datasets are possible from dumps made periodically and stored on Figshare\n(​http://opencitations.net/download​), so as to support large-scale scientometric analyses using\nthe whole content of the datasets.\n\nThe sustainability of OpenCitations\nIn order to build an infrastructure that is sustainable in the long term and that follows pure Open\nScience principles, OpenCitations has adopted in full the Principles for Open Scholarly\nInfrastructures ​(Bilder, Lin \u0026 Neylon, 2015)​, which recommend three sets of principles to which\nopen scholarly infrastructures should adhere, under the headings ​Insurance,​ ​Governance and\nSustainability.​\n\nInsurance\nAll the software released by OpenCitations is open, available on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/opencitations\nand\nreleased\nwith\nthe\nISC\nLicense\n(​https://choosealicense.com/licenses/isc/​), which is a very permissive free software license that\nallows maximum reuse of the software in different contexts, either commercial or\nnon-commercial. All the models (i.e. the OpenCitations Data Model and the SPAR Ontologies)\nused to describe the bibliographic and citation data provided OpenCitations are made available\nusing a CC-BY license (​https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/​), while all the\nOpenCitations\ndata\nare\nreleased\nusing\nthe\nCC0\npublic\ndomain\nwaiver\n(​https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/​) so as to maximise their reuse, and are\nobtainable by a variety of means, as described above.\nFinally, it is worth mentioning that OpenCitations does not hold nor will it seek to obtain any\npatent for any of its products.\n\n\fGovernance\nOpenCitations is engaged with citation data covering the whole spectrum of the scholarly\nresearch domain. In addition, all the OpenCitations applications – such as OSCAR, LUCINDA,\nand RAMOSE (​https://github.com/opencitations/ramose​), used to developed the aforementioned\nREST APIs – have been designed to be of generic usefulness, and are made available in a\nmanner that permits their reuse by members of the community in a plethora of different\nscenarios that need not be related in any way to bibliographic and citation data.\nOpenCitations is currently governed by its two Directors, the authors of this article. However, we\nplan soon to establish OpenCitations as an independent legal entity governed by a Board of\nDirectors drawn from leaders within the main stakeholder communities (librarians,\nbibliometricians, academics, data service providers, etc.) who have shown past solid\ncommitment to open scholarship. Whatever exact form the future governance of OpenCitations\ntakes, we will ensure that its original aim of free provision of open bibliographic and citation\ndata, services and software is maintained, and that OpenCitations as an organization cannot in\nfuture be taken over or controlled by commercial interests nor become involved in political,\nregulatory, legislative or financial lobbying of any kind.\nFinally, since all OpenCitations software and data are open and recorded using open standards,\nit is possible even now for third parties to take and re-use the data, or migrate it to new\nplatforms, at any time.\n\nSustainability\nSo far, OpenCitations and its products has been funded by specific grants from different\ninvestors. In particular, the first OpenCitations Corpus prototype was funded by a small\none-year grant from Jisc in 2010, which was awarded a six-month extension. There then\nfollowed a period without external funding, that ended with the award of a grant from the Alfred\nP.\nSloan\nFoundation\nfor\nThe\nOpenCitations\nEnhancement\nProject\n(​https://sloan.org/grant-detail/8017​), funding we have used to achieve the current status of\nOpenCitations. We now have a new grant from the Wellcome Trust for a one-year project\nentitled\nOpen\nBiomedical\nCitations\nin\nContext\nCorpus,\n(​https://wellcome.ac.uk/funding/people-and-projects/grants-awarded/open-biomedical-citations-c\nontext-corpus​), that will start on the 1st of July 2019.\nOpenCitations will continue to apply for targetted grants for specific projects, either alone or with\npartners, by participating in H2020 calls and by approaching additional funders and\norganisations including SCOSS (​http://scoss.org​), the Invest in Open Infrastructure\n(​https://investinopen.org​), the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation (​https://sloan.org​), the\nChan-Zuckerberg\nInitiative\n(​https://chanzuckerberg.com​),\nand\nthe\nArcadia\nFund\n(​https://www.arcadiafund.org.uk​).\n\n\fBecause all OpenCitations’ data and services are open, it has nothing to sell or against which to\ncharge membership fees. Furthermore, OpenCitations’ basic philosophy that ​all its data and\nservices should be free mitigates against any form of ‘freemium’ income generation. Long term\nsustainability for OpenCitations thus requires ongoing support from the scholarly community, for\nexample following the Invest in Open Infrastructure model (​https://investinopen.org​), or\n‘adoption’ by one or more major scholarly libraries or academic funding agencies, those\ninstitutions thus gaining credit for supporting OpenCitations in conformity with their missions. As\nsuch, OpenCitations is no different from any other open infrastructure organization that provides\nfree data services of value, such as PubMed, Europe PubMed Central or the Protein Data Bank.\nIf OpenCitations continues to expand its coverage of the scholarly domain as it has been doing\n(from ~14 million to over 445 million citations in the past year), so as to offer a genuine\nalternative in terms of coverage to the extensive citation data offered by WoS and Scopus (WoS\nhas over a billion citations), then it stands every chance of attracting financial support from\nuniversity libraries and other scholarly institutions at a fraction of the cost of their current\nsubscriptions to those commercial citation indexes.\n\nUsage statistics\nIn the past year the OpenCitations website, with all its services and pages, has been accessed\nmore than 3.1 million times by more than 68,000 unique visitors (identified by their IP\naddresses) – we have excluded from these counts all accesses made by automated agents and\nbots. Specifically, the number of accesses made between April 2018 and March 2019 (inclusive)\nis shown in ​Figure 2​, that list five main categories of information access services available in the\nwebsite, these being the direct HTTP access to a particular bibliographic resource and/or\ncitation (“HTTP_CONT_NEG”), the search/browse interfaces (“INTERFACE”), the REST APIs\n(“API”), SPARQL queries to the endpoints (“SPARQL”), and ‘other’ (visits to the OpenCitations\nhomepage and other web pages). It is worth mentioning that the APIs were formally introduced\nin June 2018, following a few internal experiments run in May 2018. They have rapidly become\nthe main service used for querying the citation data available in OpenCitations.\n\n\fFigure 2.​ The overall number of accesses to the OpenCitations website pages and services in\nthe past year, month by month. “HTTP_CONT_NEG” (i.e. HTTP content negotiation) indicates\ndirect access to stored resources by means of their HTTP URI, “INTERFACE” indicates the use\nof Web interfaces for browsing and searching bibliographic and citation data, “API” shows the\ncalls to the various OpenCitations REST APIs, “SPARQL” indicates the calls to the\nOpenCitations SPARQL endpoints, while “OTHER” lists the accesses made to all the other\nresources. Note that the y-axis is logarithmic.\nThese data are complemented by the chart shown in ​Figure 3​, which shows the number of\nrequests from different countries worldwide (identified by the IP addresses of the requests). As it\nis clear from the diagram, those countries making the most requests were Italy, Poland and the\nUnited States of America followed by Brazil, France, the Netherlands and Spain, then China,\nGermany, India and the UK.\n\n\fFigure 3.​ The map showing the relative frequency of accesses to the OpenCitations website in\nthe last year, from April 2018 to March 2019, organised per countries. Only six countries\nworldwide, coloured in white, did not access the website in the past year.\nIn ​Figure 4​, we show the statistics concerning the OpenCitations resources made available on\nFigshare (i.e. the dumps of the datasets made available by OpenCitations, as well as the\ndefinition documents). In the past year, these Figshare documents have obtained more than\n20,000 views and 3,000 downloads overall.\n\n\fFigure 4.​ The overall number of views and downloads to all the OpenCitations resources stored\nin Figshare – mainly dataset dumps and definition documents.\nAll the CSV data used to create the foregoing charts are available in ​(OpenCitations, 2019)​.\n\nAdoptions of OpenCitations by the community\nThe open citation data published by OpenCitations will benefit all scholars and researchers,\nparticularly those who are not members of the elite club of research universities that can afford\nsubscription access to WoS and Scopus. These data are of particular value to bibliometricians,\nsince they not only permit open research, but also allow re-publication of the actual data upon\nwhich the research findings are based, thus enabling the reproducibility of bibliometrics and\nscientometrics studies. This is rarely possible when the research is based on data from\nproprietary citation indexes. Such scholars will now be able to pursue their studies with greater\nfreedom, following reference trails through the citation network without hindrance, and have\ntheir own publications more easily found, discussed and cited.\nIn the past months, several researchers have already used the data provided by OpenCitations\nfor such studies. For instance, ​Kamińska (2017) published a case study showing the\npossibilities of running bibliometric analysis on the open citation data of PLOS ONE articles\navailable in the OpenCitations Corpus. COCI data, downloaded from the CSV dump available at\nhttp://opencitations.net/download​, have also been used in at least three bibliometric studies\nrecently. During the LIS Bibliometrics 2019 Event, ​Pearson (2019) presented a study run on\npublications by scholars at the University of Manchester which used COCI to retrieve citations\nbetween these publications so as to investigate possible cross-discipline and cross-department\npotential collaborations. Similarly, COCI data were used to conduct an experiment on the latest\n\n\fItalian Scientific Habilitation (the national exercise that evaluates whether a scholar is\nappropriate to receive an Associate/Full Professorship position in an Italian university), which\naimed at trying to replicate part of the outcomes of this evaluation exercise for the Computer\nScience research field using only ​open scholarly data, including the citations available in COCI,\nrather than citation data from subscription services ​(Di Iorio, Peroni, \u0026 Poggi, 2019)​. Finally,\nCOCI has also been used to explore the roles of books in scholarly communication ​(Zhu et al.,\n2019)​.\nOpenCitations data have also been used by several tools dedicated to the visualisation of\ncitation graphs and other scholarly networks. VOSviewer ​(van Eck \u0026 Waltman, 2010)\n(​http://www.vosviewer.com​) is a software tool, developed at the Leiden University’s Centre for\nScience and Technology Studies (CWTS), for constructing and visualizing bibliometric networks,\nwhich may include journals, researchers or individual publications, and may be constructed\nbased on citation, bibliographic coupling, co-citation, and co-authorship relations. Starting from\nversion 1.6.10 (released on January 10, 2019), VOSviewer can now directly use citation data\nstored in COCI, retrieved by means of the COCI REST API. Citation Gecko\n(​http://citationgecko.com​)\nand\nOCI\nGraphe\n(​https://dossier-ng.univ-st-etienne.fr/scd/www/oci/OCI_graphe_accueil.html​) are other two\nexamples of web tools that allow one to map a research citation network using some initial seed\narticles. Both of them use COCI data (accessed via the REST API) to generate the citation\nnetwork shown in the browser. An alternative visualisation tool is VisualBib\n(​http://visualbib.uniud.it/​) ​(Corbatto \u0026 Dattolo, 2018)​, that uses the data in the OpenCitations\nCorpus, among others, to support researchers who wish to create, refine and visualize\nbibliography from a small set of significant papers or from a restricted number of authors.\nIn addition to the aforementioned activities, OpenCitations is currently collaborating with a\nnumber of academic projects related to the management of bibliographic and citation data, both\nto promote the use of the OpenCitations Data Model, and to provide a publication venue for the\ncitation data that these projects are liberating from the scholarly literature. Among these, it is\nparticularly worth mentioning the Venice Scholar Index (​https://venicescholar.dhlab.epfl.ch​), the\nLinked Open Citations Database (LOC-DB, ​https://locdb.bib.uni-mannheim.de​) ​(Lauscher et al.,\n2018)​, and the EXCITE Project (​http://excite.west.uni-koblenz.de​) ​(Hosseini et al., 2019)​.\n\nConclusions and future developments\nThe main goal of OpenCitations is to provide open scholarly bibliographic and citation data and\nrelated services to all possible users, so as to allow anyone to use such data for any purpose.\nSo far, OpenCitations has released more than 450 million citations and has created several\ninterfaces for facilitating their consumption. However, the plan for the next couple of years is to\nexpand the existing citation data available, as well as to create new datasets to serve additional\nneeds.\n\n\fIn particular, following the success of COCI, OpenCitations will release the following new\nIndexes of existing open citation datasets: WOCI, the OpenCitations Index of open Wikidata\ncitations, DOCI, the OpenCitations Index of open DataCite citations, and DROCI, the\nOpenCitations Index of open citations within the Dryad Data Repository. This will allow\nOpenCitations to extend hugely the breadth of coverage of citation data available in its Indexes.\nIn a major new initiative to be undertaken in collaboration with experts in bibliometrics and\nscientometrics, OpenCitations will next develop ​OpenCitations Meta​, a new database\ncontaining additional metadata relating to scholarly publications, which will include many of the\nkinds of information described in the OpenCitations Data Model but currently lacking in the\nOpenCitations Corpus, specifically including publications’ abstracts, keywords, author affiliations\nand funding details, information of crucial value for informed bibliometric analyses of research.\nThis information will be of particular interest to universities and research institutes wishing to\nevaluate the output of their own scholars. In addition, this new database has a crucial role for\nimproving the existing OpenCitations APIs, since it would allow more complex calls on them. It\nwill also reduce the waiting time presently experienced by users, while our systems pause for\nresponses from external API services – e.g. the Crossref API (​https://api.crossref.org​) – to\nretrieve the metadata of the bibliographic resources involved in a citation.\nBy storing such extended bibliographic metadata ‘in house’ in OpenCitations Meta, we will be\nable to offer a faster and richer service, with significantly improved performance over the\ncurrent situation when querying any of the Indexes for citation information, where such\nbibliographic metadata is now pulled on-the-fly by live calls to external services. Additionally, it\nwill avoid duplication of data by efficiently permitting us to keep in the Meta database a single\ncopy of the metadata for each of the bibliographic entities involved as citing or cited entities in\nthe different OpenCitations’ citation indexes, since these same citing and cited entities may be\nreferenced independently within the different Indexes, from Crossref references, Wikidata\nreferences, DataCite references, etc.\nThese developments should be understood as a radical refocusing of OpenCitation’s data\nprovision strategy. Initially, the OpenCitations Corpus was conceived as a single database that\nwould contain all our bibliographic and citation information. Now, with the developments (i) of\nthe OpenCitations Indexes containing citation data but not metadata about the citing and cited\nbibliographic entities, (ii) of the proposed OpenCitations Meta database that will contain\nbibliographic metadata but not citation data, and (iii) of the new OpenCitations database to be\ndeveloped as part of our funded Wellcome Trust project that will house textual fragments that\nconstitute the ​citation contexts of each in-text citation occurrence – see ​(Peroni, 2018) for\nadditional information –, we are moving to a federated system of interoperable and\ncomplementary OpenCitations triplestore resources – following the guidelines in ​(COAR WG\nNext Generation Repositories, 2017)​.\nThis is because, as OpenCitations’ coverage of the global citation landscape expands, it will\nbecome technical inappropriate to handle and maintain everything (metadata, citations,\n\n\freference lists, in-text reference contexts, abstracts, etc.) within a single repository. Better to\norganize each specific data type within one of a set of complementary and interoperable\nrepositories, each encoding data in RDF according to the (expanded) OpenCitations Data\nModel, and all searchable using federated SPARQL queries.\nThis segregation of distinct data types into different triplestore repositories can then, in future,\nbe extended. And these different repositories can, if necessary, be maintained on different\ncomputers at different locations across the Internet or in the cloud, equipped with different\nhardware according to the specific needs of each repository. General interoperability will be\nguaranteed by means of SPARQL and its federated service for queries, by using the same\ngeneric data model (i.e. the OpenCitations Data Model), and by employing standard Web and\nSemantic Web protocols and standards for describing all these data.\nIn future, the OpenCitations “New Corpus” will thus be a set of federated SPARQL-based and\nOCDM-encoded repositories, each describing a specific type of data, that can talk with each\nother.\nOur plan is to continue to use the original OpenCitations Corpus database itself as a kind of\nexperimental sandbox (​https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandbox_(software_development)​) in which\nall the data types handled by OpenCitations can be stored together, and over which we can test\nnew software and new extensions to the OpenCitations Data Model on a known large but finite\nset of meaningful paper and their references harvested from the OA subset of Europe PubMed\nCentral.\nThis approach opens the possibility of wider information federation between those resources\nmaintained by OpenCitations and similar interoperable open resources maintained by third\nparties. Those might provide, for example, information about the publication types of journal\nitems (research articles, Comment and Opinion pieces, corrigenda, reviews, etc.) in one\nrepository that might be maintained by Crossref; about authors, their ORCiD and/or VIAF\nidentifiers and current and past institutional affiliations in another repository, maintained\nhopefully by ORCiD and VIAF themselves; and about (for example) the geographical focus of\npublished infectious disease reports in yet a third, possibly maintained by WHO. Those\nresources would be maintained by third parties, thereby spreading the load of providing open\nscholarly information, while what would unite them would be their use of semantic web\ntechnologies, SPARQL, and the common data model.\n\nReferences\nBilder, G., Lin, J., \u0026 Neylon, C.
